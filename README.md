# Hybrid AI Music Composer System

## Overview

This project implements a modular AI-driven music composer featuring:

- Hybrid Metaheuristic Genetic Algorithm (GA) for composing pitch, duration, velocity, and instinct fusion.
- Neural network-based AudioLayer decoders trained on synthetic and WAV-derived datasets.
- Style transfer by adapting decoders with external WAV files.
- Human-in-the-loop HIL-TTS voice synthesis pipeline for embedding search.
- Effect processing modules for advanced audio manipulation.
- Extensive sequencing, arrangement, and rendering utilities.
